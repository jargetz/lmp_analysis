Short answer: if your goal is to avoid burning Replit credits, build locally and only use Replit when you actually need their hosted preview or a deployment. Keep the Agent and AI features off unless you truly need them.

Here is a pragmatic setup.

## What costs credits on Replit

Facts:

* Replit uses a credit allowance plus pay-as-you-go for usage beyond plan allotments. Core includes a monthly credit bucket, and overages are billed usage-based. ([Replit Blog][1])
* The Agent and other AI tasks can consume credits per operation or “checkpoint.” Community and explainer posts describe this per-checkpoint model in 2025. ([Replit Builders][2])

## Lowest-credit workflow

Opinions:

1. **Develop locally.** Use your usual tools on your machine. You will incur zero Replit credits while coding locally.

2. **Use GitHub as the bridge.** Push your local repo to GitHub, then import or pull into a Repl only when you need an online preview or deployment. This keeps most iterations off Replit. ([Replit Docs][3])

3. **Define the environment once with Nix files.** Keep a `replit.nix` or compatible Nix config in the repo so the Repl spins up reproducibly without you tinkering in the Replit UI. This improves portability between local and Replit. ([Replit Blog][4])

4. **Turn off AI helpers by default.** Do not run the Agent or Ghostwriter during routine edits. Use them sparingly for specific refactors to avoid per-operation credit burn. Opinion based on the pricing mechanics cited above. ([Replit Builders][2])

5. **Preview without “real” deployments.** When you need to show something quickly, open the Repl for a short session or use the Free plan’s temporary links. Save “Deployments” for when you truly need uptime. This minimizes credit draw from hosted resources. ([Replit][5])

6. **Batch your Replit usage.** Make changes locally, then push a set of commits and test in one short Replit session rather than keeping the Repl open all afternoon. Opinion.

## Should you stay entirely inside Replit

Opinion:

* If you want the smoothest zero-setup browser dev and you value AI features, staying inside Replit is convenient, but it is easier to leak credits.
* If your priority is cost control, do most work locally and treat Replit as a deploy and demo surface. That hybrid approach usually keeps spend low while still giving you one-click hosting when you need it.

## Simple checklist

Opinions:

* Local dev in VS Code or your editor
* Repo on GitHub
* Add `replit.nix` now so Replit mirrors your local stack
* Only open Replit to test or deploy
* Keep Agent and Ghostwriter off by default
* Prefer brief preview sessions over always-on deployments

If you want, tell me your stack, and I will sketch the exact `replit.nix` and a small GitHub-to-Replit workflow script to make this smooth.
